## What this repository is

This is the **design documentation** for the *Mk3 Reference Loudspeaker* — a
DIY active 3-way reference loudspeaker, inspired by the Genelec 8361,
Dutch & Dutch 8C, and Revel Salon2.

It is a **documentation-only repository**. There is no source code, no build
system, no tests, no package manager. Everything is Markdown. The "product" is
the engineering reasoning behind the speaker design, captured as a living
"Design Bible" plus supporting reference files.

The project is currently at the **simulation / design-candidate stage** (design
version **v8**). No physical prototype has been built yet. Most numbers are
simplified simulation estimates, not measured data — preserve that distinction
in any edits.

## The two key conventions

### 1. Design versions (vN)

The whole project is organized around incrementing design versions, tracked in
`ROADMAP.md` (full history) and `CHANGELOG.md` (changes, newest first). The
current design candidate is **v8**. Further v9+ are planned/future and describe
intended work.

When the design changes, bump or annotate the version and record it in both
`ROADMAP.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

### 2. Numbered design decisions (DD-NNN)

`DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` records each significant choice as `DD-NNN` with three
sections: **Decision**, **Reasoning**, and (usually) **Consequence**. Keep this
format when adding one.

## The current spec — keep it consistent

This summary appears verbatim (or near-verbatim) in **multiple files**:
`README.md`, `docs/00_design_bible.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md`, and `PARTS.md`. If you change any spec value, you
**must update every place it appears** — otherwise the docs contradict each
other.

### Current spec (v8)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Woofers | 2 × GRS 12SW-4HE (push-push, side-mounted, 12" high excursion) |
| Midrange | ScanSpeak 15W/4434G00 (sealed mid chamber ~5.7 L) |
| Tweeter | SB Acoustics SB26STAC-C000-4 (bare dome, not horn-loaded) |
| Tweeter waveguide | `cad/waveguide.scad` |
| Cabinet | 300 × 370 × 1080 mm, 22 mm birch plywood, R50 front roundovers |
| Bass volume | ~75 L sealed (under divider plate), sealed Fc ~39 Hz → 28 Hz via LT, Qtc ~0.707 |
| Bass/mid xover | 150 Hz LR4 |
| Mid/tweeter xover | 1100 Hz LR4 |
| Mid/tweeter c-c | 140 mm |
| System | Active, DSP-controlled (no passive crossover) |

## Writing conventions

- **Markdown only.** GitHub-flavored. Tables for parameter lists, `## headings`,
  checkbox lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) for tasks.
- **Units are metric** and explicit: mm, L (litres), Hz, Ω, dB. Crossover slopes
  are written as `LR4` (Linkwitz-Riley 4th order). Center-to-center spacing is
  `c-c`. Roundover radii are `RNN` (e.g. `R50`).
- **Hedge appropriately.** Use "approx." / "~" / "target" / "estimate" for any
  value that comes from simplified simulation rather than measurement. The repo
  is deliberately careful that simulated direction ≠ final measured truth (see
  the top of `SIMULATIONS.md` and `MEASUREMENTS.md`). Preserve this tone.
- Design Bible chapters generally open with a `## Requirements` or context
  section, walk through options investigated, and end with a status / decision.
  Match that structure when adding or extending a chapter.
- Cross-link with relative Markdown links (e.g. `[Chapter 8](08_push_push_bass.md)`
  from within `docs/`, or `docs/...` from the repo root).
- Keep the chapter status table in `docs/00_design_bible.md` and the file index
  in `README.md` in sync with the actual files in `docs/`.

## Development workflow

There is nothing to build, lint, or run. The workflow is purely editorial:

1. Make the documentation change.
2. Propagate any spec change to every file that repeats it (see the spec table above).
3. If it's a design change, update `CHANGELOG.md` and `ROADMAP.md`; if it's a
   decision, add/extend a `DD-NNN` entry; tick or add items in `PROJECT_TODO.md`.
4. Commit with a clear, conventional-style message and push.

### Git conventions

- Commit messages follow a loose conventional style seen in history:
  `docs: ...`, `fix: ...`, or short imperative summaries (`Add chapter 3 woofer selection`).
- Use `git push -u origin <branch>`.
- **Do not open a pull request unless explicitly asked.**

## What does NOT exist yet (don't assume it does)

These are referenced as aspirations in `PROJECT_TODO.md` / `SIMULATIONS.md` but are not
in the repo:

- CSV datasets or measured-data files
- Exported meshes (STL/STEP) or 2D panel drawings / cut lists
- VituixCAD project files, REW measurements or presets
- Any actual measurement data (the build hasn't started)

Partially present (simulation-stage, estimates only — extend, don't assume
finished): `simulations/` holds version-controlled Python scripts + plots, and
`cad/` holds parametric OpenSCAD models for the waveguide and the cabinet.

If asked to "add the simulation" or "generate the CAD," check `simulations/` and
`cad/` first and extend them; exported meshes, drawings and measured data would
still be new artifact types — confirm scope before creating those.

## Domain glossary (quick reference)

- **Push-push** — two woofers mounted on opposite sides, wired so cones move
  outward together, cancelling cabinet reaction forces. The rear/opposite driver
  is wired reversed polarity to achieve this (see Chapter 8).
- **Spinorama** — the standardized set of curves (on-axis, listening window,
  early reflections, sound power, predicted in-room, directivity index).
- **Waveguide** — the project's custom ~212 mm-mouth non-horn-loaded waveguide
  for the SB26STAC-C000-4 dome tweeter (`cad/waveguide.scad`).
- **Qtc / Fc** — total system Q and resonant frequency of the sealed bass alignment.
- **LR4** — Linkwitz-Riley 4th-order (24 dB/oct) acoustic crossover target.
- **DSP / active** — crossovers, delay, and EQ are done electronically per driver
  channel; there is intentionally no passive crossover (decision DD-001).
